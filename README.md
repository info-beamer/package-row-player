# Playing content across multiple screens arranged in a row

This package allows you to control screens arranged in a horizontal row.
Right now up to four screens are supported, but this limit can be raised
if needed.

Content can be placed on individual screens or across multiple or
even all screens. All content is played in sync, so screens all
switch to the next content at the same time. This allows you to
(for example) show a menu board and switch to a multi-screen
video.
